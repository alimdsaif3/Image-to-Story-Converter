## üéØ Key Features  

1. **Image to Text**  
   - Uses Hugging Face's image-to-text transformer model ([Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)) to analyze the image and generate descriptive text.  

2. **Text to Story**  
   - Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to create a short, imaginative story (default: 50 words) from the descriptive text.  

3. **Story to Speech**  
   - Converts the story into a narrated audio file using Hugging Face's text-to-speech model ([espnet/kan-bayashi_ljspeech_vits](https://huggingface.co/espnet/kan-bayashi_ljspeech_vits)).  

4. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - Built with Streamlit for easy image uploading and playback of generated audio.
